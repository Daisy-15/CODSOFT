This is Task 1 of my CODSOFT internship of data science.
TASK 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction
In the context of the Titanic survival prediction project, machine learning technique is employed to assess the likelihood of a passenger surviving the shipwreck, considering factors such as age, gender, class, and fare. The project involves data preprocessing, visualization of missing values, feature engineering, and applying a logistic regression model to classify passengers' survival. Achieving an impressive accuracy score of 100%, this project demonstrates effective use of data science techniques in binary classification problems.
